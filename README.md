# Cpp-CPU-Core-Count

A quick test written to see which method of calculating CPU cores is fastest. I understand that fastest may not always be the best. Added additional tests to time two different SplitString methods. Set #define flags to true to determine which tests will run.

## To setup and compile

1. Clone repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ryancarr/Cpp-CPU-Core-Count.git
```

2. Compile and run
```
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main
./main
```
